# Printer Extruder Design Optimization
Dedicated to a design optimization course, ENME410
* Semester long project: *Optimization of 3D printer extruder with objective of weight and cost minimization* (modelled from Creality Ender 5)
* Tools & techniques used include optimization toolbox with Matlab, Excel GRG optimizer, constrained optimzation, Genetic Algorithm, and custom Augmented Lagragian Method
* Credits are also given to **Max Kim** and **Spencer Cutter**
